# Assignment 02 - Milestone 02

**Due March 16 (W) @ 9 PM**

**Worth 3% of your final grade**

**Content in this milestone document takes precedence over anything you read in the [assignment pdf](comp-3512-a2-v1.pdf).**

## Overview

This second milestone will have you creating 3 of the pages that make up the finished site:

1. Home (Not Logged-In Version)
2. Login
3. About

In addition, the site has a navigation Header that displays in "hamburger style" at Mobile L size.

## The Starting Repository

As in milestone 3 of assignment 1, you'll be working in a team repository from this point onward.

The starting team repo is here: https://classroom.github.com/a/_FxZmykA

Like last time, you'll be asked to select a team:

![team selection](images/mile-02-team-view.png)

**Join the team you were told you are on - it's shown in the [teamwork.md](teamwork.md) document. Please do NOT create a new team.**

Like last time, you all have admin privs on this repo.

## Your Mark

### Oops Policy

If you make a simple mistake at Level 0 through 3, a modified Oops Policy is in effect: the group gets an opportunity to fix TWO oopsies. (I think that's the plural of "oops".) 

### The Ladder

|         Level 5          |       98%       |


#### The Ladder Details

#### Level 0

If the following aren't met, I won't mark your submission. Most of these have been done previously, so as long as you haven't busted anything, there is no real work to do here!

The one exception is L0.4 - keep that HTML validating! (This is not just some busywork requirement - it truly does help you avoid a lot of wonky issues with your visual design.)

- [ ] [L0.1] The Feedback pull request in the repo has not been closed or merged.

- [ ] [L0.2] The name of your Heroku application is `comp-3512-w22-team-xx`, where `xx` is the 2 digits of your team.

- [ ] [L0.3] There is a working link in the team repo's `README.md` that takes you to the Heroku URL for your application; this should cause your `index.php` to be displayed.

- [ ] [L0.4]  When the Home, Login, and About pages are validated by the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), no errors are present.

    _Warnings are OK, though I do reserve the right to roll me eyes and sigh melodramatically._
