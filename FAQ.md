#### Q. Do I need to use PHP to create the movies shown on the Browse page?

> _A. Actually, no. You can use a lot of your assignment 1 logic here.  You will need to adjust your URLs a bit to take you to the correct single-move.php page. And faving things will need to involve PHP. But you can still have data from the API (your API!) stored in the browser's session storage like last time._ 

#### Q. Where should I put my html, css, images, and js files?

> _A. Put them inside your `public` folder. I'd suggest making subfolders for your css, images, and js stuff. Partials, constants, settings and such should go outside of the public folder._
