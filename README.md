# COMP2512 - Assignment 2: Movie Browser Site

## Overview

Assignment 2 takes assignment 1 and runs with it a bit. Instead of being an SPA (single page application), you now will be dealing with multiple pages driven by a database on the back end. With PHP serving up all responses. 

What's not to like?

Read [the assignment pdf](comp-3512-a2-v1.pdf) to get a feel for what's ahead. I think I've learned my lesson from assignment 1 and have taken the time to make the pdf a tad more useful out of the gate. 

## Extensions

We're back to the extension policy in the course outline again. If you alter the main branch on GitHub after the submission deadline, I'll assume you want an extension and ping karma accordingly.

If you want to avoid me assuming you're asking for an extension when you're really not, I recommend working on a branch other than main until you receive your feedback from me. You can then merge that work back onto main and carry on with your life. Get in touch with me if you can't figure out how to do this.

## Staying In The Loop

Large projects, whether in "the real world" or in a course, are liable to change over time. You should Watch (in the GitHub sense) this repository - just as I'm assuming you're doing for the shared-course-material repository - to stay in the loop about important changes to instructions, clarification of fuzzy points, and the like.
