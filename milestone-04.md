# Assignment 02 - Milestone 04 (WIP)

**Due March 30 (W) @ 9 PM**

**Worth 3% of your final grade**

**Content in this milestone document takes precedence over anything you read in the [assignment pdf](comp-3512-asg-1-winter-2020-current.pdf).**


## Overview

This fourth milestone will have you focusing on 4 main tasks:

1. Implementing the Title Search (from Home) functionality.
2. Implementing an API to provide data to the Title Search.
3. Implementing the Login functionality.
4. Continuing work on your visual design.

## User Table Import

Since you need to get Login working, you'll need some users to test things out with. There is a [users.sql](data/users.sql) script you can use to create the necessary users table with a handful of users prepopulated in it. You can use the script just like you did for the `populate-movies.sql` script in the last milestone.

## Category Details

### Must-Haves

If the following aren't met, I won't mark your submission. Most of these have been done previously, so as long as you haven't busted anything, there is no real work to do here!

- [ ] [MH.1] The Feedback pull request in the repo has not been closed or merged.

- [ ] [MH.2] The name of your Heroku application is `comp-3512-w22-team-xx`, where `xx` is the 2 digits of your team.

- [ ] [MH.3] There is a working link in the team repo's `README.md` that takes you to the Heroku URL for your application; this should cause your `index.php` to be displayed. 

    _I will be marking the site you link to via this README, so make sure it's the one you want assessed!_

- [ ] [MH.4]  When the Default page is validated by the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), no errors are present. Warnings are ok.

    _As last time, I'm going to assume you haven't busted the pages you previously validated._

- [ ] [MH.5] The "plumbing" that was used in milestone 1 is present here: a valid Procfile, composer.json, and public folder containing your site's viewable files are present.

### Visual Design 

The visual design of all Views will be evaluated at **both** Mobile L and Laptop L size in a Chrome browser. 

It's important that your site has a unified visual "feel".

Also, since you've all received a variety of visual design feedback over the course of assignment one, my expectations here will be higher.

#### Level 0

- [ ] I don't think this is even possible! This would have to be some kind of visual design that makes me want to cry, or perhaps curl up into a fetal ball somewhere.

#### Level 1

- [ ] The overall impression of the site is "oh dear...". Perhaps the different pages don't share a visual theme at all and are stitched together from disparate assignment one designs?  Or perhaps there are just so many issues that I lose count? In any case, you wouldn't want to show this to a potential employer or client.

#### Level 2

- [ ] The overall impression of the site is "OK" - it's basically reproductions of the illustrations shown in the pdf and give the impression that the visual design was not given much attention. It's not hard to find issues with the design, but they're not show-stoppers. You'd be a bit hesitant showing this to a potential employer or client.

#### Level 3

- [ ] The overall impression of the site is "hey, this is pretty good!" - pages deviate occasionally and reasonably from the illustrations shown in the pdf and give the impression that the visual design was given some thought and attention. While there are perhaps still a few areas that obviously need a bit of work, you'd probably be pretty confident showing this to a potential employer or client.

#### Level 4

- [ ] The overall impression of the site is "wow" - pages deviate frequently and thoughtfully from the illustrations shown in the pdf and give the impression that the visual design was a focus of attention. It's difficult to find issues - and they are likely quibbles. You would show this to a potential employer or client with no hesitation whatsoever.

#### Level 5

- [ ] This will be difficult to reach, as basically the site looks like it was designed by a person who does this kind of thing for a living.
