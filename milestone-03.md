# Assignment 02 - Milestone 03

**Due March 23 (W) @ 9 PM**

**Worth 3% of your final grade**

**Content in this milestone document takes precedence over anything you read in the [assignment pdf](comp-3512-asg-1-winter-2020-current.pdf).**

## Overview

This third milestone will have you focusing on 3 main tasks:

1. Client-side validation of the registration form (using JS!),
2. Query string validation of URLs used for the Movie Details page, and
3. Presenting the Movie Details page for a given movie.

In addition, you will want to put effort into the visual design of your site.


## A Suggestion

I won't be making you use the projects feature of GitHub as I did in assignment one...but I hope you realize that it can be a powerful tool for making clear what tasks your team needs to do and by when and by whom. (Or is that who? I always forget.)

These kind of boards are used in industry, so why not practice using them while you're a student?...

## Your Mark

Much like with assignment 1's milestone 6, I'll be marking this (and remaining milestones) by using categories, each marked on a Ladder.

As you might suspect, the 4 categories for this milestone correspond to the 3 main tasks mentioned in the Overview, plus visual design.

### Category Weightings

| Category                                   | Weight |
| ------------------------------------------ | :----: |
| Client-Side Registration Form Validation   |  30%   |
| Movie Details Page Query String Validation |  20%   |
| Movie Details Page Presentation            |  35%   |
| Visual Design                              |  15%   |

### The Ladders

Each of the categories will use the same Ladder.

| Completed Req's Sections | Corresponding % |
| :----------------------: | :-------------: |
|         Level 0          |       0%        |
|         Level 1          |       52%       |
|         Level 2          |       65%       |
|         Level 3          |       75%       |
|         Level 4          |       88%       |
|         Level 5          |       98%       |

_In case you were wondering, these numbers correspond to the midpoints of D, C, B, A, and A+ grades in [MRU's official common grading system](https://catalog.mtroyal.ca/content.php?catoid=29&navoid=2315&hl=%22Academic+Status%22&returnto=search&print)._

## Category Details

### Must Haves

If the following aren't met, I won't mark your submission. Most of these have been done previously, so as long as you haven't busted anything, there is no real work to do here!

- [ ] [MH.1] The Feedback pull request in the repo has not been closed or merged.

- [ ] [MH.2] The name of your Heroku application is `comp-3512-w22-team-xx`, where `xx` is the 2 digits of your team.

- [ ] [MH.3] There is a working link in the team repo's `README.md` that takes you to the Heroku URL for your application; this should cause your `index.php` to be displayed.

- [ ] [MH.4]  When the Movie Details page is validated by the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), no errors are present. Warnings are ok.

    _I'm going to assume you haven't busted the pages you previously validated, which is _adorably_ Pollyannaish of me, but I gotta be me._

### Client-Side Registration Form Validation


### Movie Details Page Query String Validation


### Movie Details Page Presentation 


### Visual Design 

The visual design of all Views will be evaluated at **both** Mobile L and Laptop L size in a Chrome browser. 

It's important that your site has a unified visual "feel".

Also, since you've all received a variety of visual design feedback over the course of assignment 1, my expectations here will be higher.

#### Level 0

- [ ] I don't think this is even possible! This would have to be some kind of visual design that makes me want to cry, or perhaps curl up into a fetal ball somewhere.

#### Level 1

- [ ] The overall impression of the site is "oh dear...". Perhaps the different pages don't share a visual theme at all? Or perhaps there are just so many issues that I lose count? In any case, you wouldn't want to show this to a potential employer or client.

#### Level 2

- [ ] The overall impression of the Views is "OK" - they're basically reproductions of the illustrations shown in the pdf and give the impression that the visual design was not given much attention. It's not hard to find issues with the design, but they're not show-stoppers. You'd be a bit hesitant showing this to a potential employer or client.

#### Level 3

- [ ] The overall impression of the Views is "hey, that's good!" - they deviate occasionally and reasonably from the illustrations shown in the pdf and give the impression that the visual design was given some thought and attention. While there are a few areas that obviously need a bit of work, you'd probably be pretty confident showing this to a potential employer or client.

#### Level 4

- [ ] The overall impression of the Views is "wow" - they deviate frequently and thoughtfully from the illustrations shown in the pdf and give the impression that the visual design was a focus of attention. It's difficult, if not impossible, to find issue with the Views and any such issues are likely quibbles. You would show this to a potential employer or client with no hesitation whatsoever.

#### Level 5

- [ ] This will be difficult to reach, as basically the site looks like it was done by a person who does this kind of thing for a living.
