# Assignment 02 - Milestone 03

**Due March 23 (W) @ 9 PM**

**Worth 3% of your final grade**

**Content in this milestone document takes precedence over anything you read in the [assignment pdf](comp-3512-asg-1-winter-2020-current.pdf).**

## Overview

This third milestone will have you focusing on 3 main tasks:

1. Client-side validation of the registration form (using JS!),
2. Query string validation of URLs used for the Movie Details page, and
3. Presenting the Movie Details page for a given movie.

In addition, you will want to put effort into the visual design of your site.


## A Suggestion

I won't be making you use the projects feature of GitHub as I did in assignment one...but I hope you realize that it can be a powerful tool for making clear what tasks your team needs to do and by when and by whom. (Or is that who? I always forget.)

These kind of boards are used in industry, so why not practice using them while you're a student?...

## Your Mark

Much like with assignment 1's milestone 6, I'll be marking this (and remaining milestones) by using categories, each marked with their own Ladder.

As you might suspect, the 4 categories for this milestone correspond to the 3 main tasks mentioned in the Overview, plus visual design.

### Category Weightings

| Category                                   | Weight |
| ------------------------------------------ | :----: |
| Client-Side Registration Form Validation   |  30%   |
| Movie Details Page Query String Validation |  20%   |
| Movie Details Page Presentation            |  35%   |
| Visual Design                              |  15%   |

### The Ladders

Each of the categories will use the same Ladder.

| Completed Req's Sections | Corresponding % |
| :----------------------: | :-------------: |
|         Level 0          |       0%        |
|         Level 1          |       52%       |
|         Level 2          |       65%       |
|         Level 3          |       75%       |
|         Level 4          |       88%       |
|         Level 5          |       98%       |

_In case you were wondering, these numbers correspond to the midpoints of D, C, B, A, and A+ grades on [MRU's official common grading system](https://catalog.mtroyal.ca/content.php?catoid=29&navoid=2315&hl=%22Academic+Status%22&returnto=search&print)._

#### Category Details

#### Must Haves

If the following aren't met, I won't mark your submission. Most of these have been done previously, so as long as you haven't busted anything, there is no real work to do here!

I'll be validating a single page in this milestone - I'm going to assume you haven't busted the pages you previously validated, which is _adorably_ Pollyannaish of me, but I gotta be me.

- [ ] [MH.1] The Feedback pull request in the repo has not been closed or merged.

- [ ] [MH.2] The name of your Heroku application is `comp-3512-w22-team-xx`, where `xx` is the 2 digits of your team.

- [ ] [MH.3] There is a working link in the team repo's `README.md` that takes you to the Heroku URL for your application; this should cause your `index.php` to be displayed.

- [ ] [MH.4]  When the Movie Details page is validated by the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), no errors are present. Warnings are ok.
