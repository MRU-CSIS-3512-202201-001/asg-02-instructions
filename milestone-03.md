# Assignment 02 - Milestone 03

**Due March 23 (W) @ 9 PM**

**Worth 3% of your final grade**

**Content in this milestone document takes precedence over anything you read in the [assignment pdf](comp-3512-asg-1-winter-2020-current.pdf).**

## Overview

This third milestone will have you focusing on 3 main tasks:

1. Client-side validation of the registration form (using JS!),
2. Query string validation of URLs used for the Movie Details page, and
3. Displaying the Movie Details page for a given movie.

In addition, you will want to put effort into the visual design of your site.

#### The Ladder Details

#### Level 0

If the following aren't met, I won't mark your submission. Most of these have been done previously, so as long as you haven't busted anything, there is no real work to do here!

The one exception is L0.4 - keep that HTML validating! (This is not just some busywork requirement - it truly does help you avoid a lot of wonky issues with your visual design.)

- [ ] [L0.1] The Feedback pull request in the repo has not been closed or merged.

- [ ] [L0.2] The name of your Heroku application is `comp-3512-w22-team-xx`, where `xx` is the 2 digits of your team.

- [ ] [L0.3] There is a working link in the team repo's `README.md` that takes you to the Heroku URL for your application; this should cause your `index.php` to be displayed.

- [ ] [L0.4]
